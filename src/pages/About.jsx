      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
      <p>
        I was born in Ecuador and came to the U.S. with big dreams of building a better future. That journey shaped my resilience and my drive to keep learning, no matter how challenging the path.</p>

        <p>Today, I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering while working full-time in sales at Lexus, where I’ve built over a decade of experience in communication, customer relationships, and problem-solving. My background in graphic design, paired with my professional career in sales, has given me a unique blend of creativity, empathy, and business sense that I now bring into my software engineering journey.</p>

        <p>I love coding because it challenges me every day, whether I’m debugging, experimenting with new frameworks, or learning how to turn an idea into an interactive project. The joy for me is not only in solving problems, but in creating solutions that feel clean, intuitive, and meaningful to others.</p>

        <p>My goal is to grow into a Software engineer with strong UI/UX skills while continuously building projects that reflect both technical depth and personal creativity.

        Outside of tech, I love traveling, being outdoors, and spending time with my son and our dog, Drake. These photos are a glimpse of the moments that inspire me along the way.
